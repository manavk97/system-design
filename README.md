## System Design Concepts

### 1. Distributed System Design Patterns

Distributed system design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered when designing large-scale, distributed systems. These patterns help in creating scalable, reliable, and efficient systems.

#### 1.1. [Data Management Patterns](#11-data-management-patterns)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Cache-Aside | Load data on demand into a cache from a data store |
| CQRS | Segregate operations that read data from operations that update data by using separate interfaces |
| Event Sourcing | Use an append-only store to record the full series of events that describe actions taken on data in a domain |
| Index Table | Create indexes over the fields in data stores that are frequently referenced by queries |
| Materialized View | Generate prepopulated views over the data in one or more data stores when the data isn't ideally formatted for required query operations |
| Sharding | Divide a data store into a set of horizontal partitions or shards |
| Static Content Hosting | Deploy static content to a cloud-based storage service that can deliver them directly to the client |
| Valet Key | Use a token or key that provides clients with restricted direct access to a specific resource or service |

#### 1.2. [Design and Implementation Patterns](#12-design-and-implementation-patterns)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Ambassador | Create helper services that send network requests on behalf of a consumer service or application. |
| Anti-Corruption Layer | Implement a fa√ßade or adapter layer between a modern application and a legacy system. |
| Backends for Frontends | Create separate backend services to be consumed by specific frontend applications or interfaces. |
| CQRS | Segregate operations that read data from operations that update data by using separate interfaces. |
| Compute Resource Consolidation | Consolidate multiple tasks or operations into a single computational unit |
| Edge Workload Configuration | The great variety of systems and devices on the shop floor can make workload configuration a difficult problem. |
| External Configuration Store | Move configuration information out of the application deployment package to a centralized location. |
| Gateway Aggregation | Use a gateway to aggregate multiple individual requests into a single request. |
| Gateway Offloading | Offload shared or specialized service functionality to a gateway proxy. |
| Gateway Routing | Route requests to multiple services using a single endpoint. |
| Leader Election | Coordinate the actions performed by a collection of collaborating task instances in a distributed application by electing one instance as the leader that assumes responsibility for managing the other instances. |
| Pipes and Filters | Break down a task that performs complex processing into a series of separate elements that can be reused. |
| Sidecar | Deploy components of an application into a separate process or container to provide isolation and encapsulation. |
| Static Content Hosting | Deploy static content to a cloud-based storage service that can deliver them directly to the client. |
| Strangler Fig | Incrementally migrate a legacy system by gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services. |

#### 1.3. [Messaging Patterns](#13-messaging-patterns)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Asynchronous Request-Reply | Decouple backend processing from a frontend host, where backend processing needs to be asynchronous, but the frontend still needs a clear response. |
| Claim Check | Split a large message into a claim check and a payload to avoid overwhelming a message bus. |
| Choreography | Have each component of the system participate in the decision-making process about the workflow of a business transaction, instead of relying on a central point of control. |
| Competing Consumers | Enable multiple concurrent consumers to process messages received on the same messaging channel. |
| Pipes and Filters | Break down a task that performs complex processing into a series of separate elements that can be reused. |
| Priority Queue | Prioritize requests sent to services so that requests with a higher priority are received and processed more quickly than those with a lower priority. |
| Publisher-Subscriber | Enable an application to announce events to multiple interested consumers asynchronously, without coupling the senders to the receivers. |
| Queue-Based Load Leveling | Use a queue that acts as a buffer between a task and a service that it invokes in order to smooth intermittent heavy loads. |
| Saga | Manage data consistency across microservices in distributed transaction scenarios. A saga is a sequence of transactions that updates each service and publishes a message or event to trigger the next transaction step. |
| Scheduler Agent Supervisor | Coordinate a set of actions across a distributed set of services and other remote resources. |
| Sequential Convoy | Process a set of related messages in a defined order, without blocking processing of other groups of messages |
| Actor Model | A computational model for concurrent computation where actors are the universal primitives of computation. |

### 2. Design Patterns (OOP)

#### 2.1 Creational patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Factory Method | Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate |
| Abstract Factory | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes |
| Builder | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations |
| Prototype | Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype |
| Singleton | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it |

#### 2.2 Structural patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Adapter | Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate |
| Bridge | Separates an object's abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently |
| Composite | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies |
| Decorator | Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically |
| Facade | Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes |
| Flyweight | Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently |
| Proxy | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it |

#### 2.3 Behavioral patterns 

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Chain of Responsibility | Passes requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain |
| Command | Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request |
| Iterator | Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation |
| Mediator | Reduces chaotic dependencies between objects by restricting direct communications between the objects and forcing them to collaborate only via a mediator object |
| Memento | Lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation |
| Observer | Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing |
| State | Lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes |
| Strategy | Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable |
| Template Method | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure |
| Visitor | Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate |
