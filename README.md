These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Only one environment is live at any time, allowing for seamless updates and quick rollback if issues arise during deployment. | - Reduces downtime and risk of service disruption.<br>- Allows for quick rollback if issues arise during deployment. | - Requires maintaining two identical environments.<br>- Increases operational overhead. |
| Canary Deployment | In this strategy, a new version of the application is rolled out to a small subset of users before a full-scale deployment. This allows teams to monitor the new version for issues and gather feedback before wider release. | - Allows for controlled testing of new versions.<br>- Helps in gathering user feedback before full deployment. | - Requires careful user selection and monitoring.<br>- May not be suitable for all types of applications. |
| Rolling Deployment | This method gradually replaces instances of the previous version of the application with the new version. It minimizes downtime as the deployment occurs in phases across the infrastructure. | - Reduces downtime and risk of service disruption.<br>- Allows for continuous service availability. | - Requires careful planning and execution.<br>- Can be complex to manage in large-scale deployments. |
| Recreate Deployment | This pattern involves stopping the old version of the application and then starting the new version. While simple, it can lead to downtime as there is no overlap between the old and new versions. | - Simple to implement.<br>- Ensures a clean start with the new version. | - Leads to downtime during deployment.<br>- Potential for initial confusion among users. |
| A/B Testing | This approach involves deploying two versions of an application (A and B) to different user groups to compare performance and user engagement. This helps in making data-driven decisions about which version to adopt fully. | - Allows for direct comparison of different versions.<br>- Helps in making data-driven decisions. | - Requires careful user segmentation and monitoring.<br>- Increases operational overhead. |
| Shadow Deployment | In shadow deployment, the new version of an application runs alongside the old version, but only receives a copy of the production traffic. This allows for testing without impacting the user experience. | - Allows for testing without affecting production traffic.<br>- Helps in gathering user feedback before full deployment. | - Requires careful configuration and monitoring.<br>- May not be suitable for all types of applications. |
| Microservices Deployment | This pattern emphasizes deploying small, independently deployable services that communicate over a network. Each service can be updated and scaled independently, enhancing flexibility and resilience. | - Enhances flexibility and scalability.<br>- Allows for independent updates and scaling. | - More complex to manage and coordinate.<br>- Requires careful orchestration. |
| Serverless Deployment | This pattern allows developers to deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Functions are executed in response to events, automatically scaling as needed. | - Simplifies infrastructure management.<br>- Reduces operational overhead. | - May not be suitable for all types of applications.<br>- Can be less flexible for certain use cases. |
| Event-Driven Deployment | This approach leverages events to trigger deployments and updates, allowing for more dynamic and responsive systems that react to changes in real-time. | - Enhances responsiveness and adaptability.<br>- Reduces manual intervention. | - More complex to implement and manage.<br>- Requires careful event handling and integration. |
| Immutable Deployment | In this pattern, once an application version is deployed, it is never modified. Any updates involve deploying a new version, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of configuration drift. | - Ensures consistency and reduces configuration drift.<br>- Simplifies deployment process. | - Requires careful version management and potential for increased deployment frequency. |

#### 4.9. [System Problems](#49-system-problems)

| Problems | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| Noisy Neighbour | A single tenant or application consumes disproportionate resources (like CPU, memory, or bandwidth), negatively impacting the performance of other tenants sharing the same infrastructure. Solutions often involve resource allocation strategies, workload prioritization, and monitoring to mitigate the effects of one tenant's resource hogging. |
| Thundering Herd | Many processes or threads attempt to access a shared resource simultaneously, leading to contention and performance degradation. Techniques like exponential backoff or implementing a queuing mechanism can help alleviate this issue. |
| Cache Stampede | Multiple requests for the same resource hit a cache simultaneously, causing a surge in load on the backend system when the cache misses. Strategies such as request coalescing or using a locking mechanism to ensure only one request populates the cache can be employed. |
| Load Imbalance | The distribution of workload across servers or nodes is uneven, leading to some resources being overutilized while others remain underutilized. Dynamic load balancing algorithms that redistribute tasks based on current load metrics can help address this problem. |
| Split-Brain Syndrome | Network partitions lead to multiple nodes believing they are the primary node, resulting in conflicting operations and data inconsistencies. Consensus algorithms like Paxos or Raft can help maintain a single source of truth. |
| Resource Starvation | One or more processes are perpetually denied the resources they need to proceed because other processes are continuously consuming those resources. Implementing fair scheduling algorithms and resource quotas can help mitigate this issue. |
| Latency Issues | Delays in data transfer or processing, often due to network congestion or inefficient data handling. Techniques to reduce latency include optimizing data paths, using content delivery networks (CDNs), and implementing caching strategies. |
