|---------|-------------|
| [Asynchronous Request-Reply](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/async-request-reply) | Decouple backend processing from a frontend host, where backend processing needs to be asynchronous, but the frontend still needs a clear response. |

### 2. Design Patterns (OOP)

#### 2.1 [Creational Patterns](#21-creational-patterns)

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) | Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate |
| [Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory) | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes |
| [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder) | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations |
| [Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype) | Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype |
| [Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton) | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it |

#### 2.2. [Structural Patterns](#22-structural-patterns)

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter) | Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate |
| [Bridge](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge) | Separates an object's abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently |
| [Composite](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite) | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies |
| [Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator) | Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically |
| [Facade](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade) | Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes |
| [Flyweight](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight) | Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently |
| [Proxy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/proxy) | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it |

#### 2.3. [Behavioral Patterns](#23-behavioral-patterns)

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Chain of Responsibility | Passes requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain |
| [Command](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command) | Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request |
| [Iterator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator) | Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation |
| [Mediator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator) | Reduces chaotic dependencies between objects by restricting direct communications between the objects and forcing them to collaborate only via a mediator object |
| [Memento](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/memento) | Lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation |
| [Observer](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer) | Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing |
| [State](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state) | Lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes |
| [Strategy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy) | Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable |
| [Template Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method) | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure |
| [Visitor](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor) | Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate |
